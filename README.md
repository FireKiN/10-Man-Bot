# 10-Man-Bot
## About

After having played many CS:GO 10-mans(Scrimmages) with friends, and after the chaos of getting everyone to stop talking in
Discord so that we can decide on two team captains, then getting everyone to be on the right team after countless lies of "Oh I
thought I was on this team, my bad", I decided to create a Discord API that allows us to create a 10-man without anybody having to
talk. Keep in mind that this is my first time using Github for a project, and I also decided to start using Github pretty late in development of this bot because I can ;). 

## The Bot

In order to get the bot into your Discord server you must either be the server owner or have the Manage Server permission enabled.
With that, you can invite the bot to your server using this [invite link](https://discordapp.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=278352456738406400&scope=bot&permissions=1409637424).

## As of 02/11/2017

This bot is currently at version 1.0.0. It works just the way I wanted it to work in the beginning. With that being said, I do plan
on improving this bot while also cleaning up and optimizing the code. Stay tuned for updates.
